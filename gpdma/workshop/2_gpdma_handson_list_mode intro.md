# GPDMA handson adding features

## Current state

* ADC convert samples
* ADC generate request for GPDMA
* GPDMA transfer data to memory

## Next Step

* Now we do the same but with **LLI list**.
* Which allow us later add more lists in later steps

# Classic DMA circular mode

Classical DMA had bit which allow repeat the configuration.
When DMA finished it automatically reload previous configuration.

# GPDMA list mode

The GPDMA have different approach
It have **lists** containing **configuration** which is used by **GPDMA**.

When GPDMA ends it looking for new configuration based on LLR register. If is found it reload own registrs with it also with new LLR.
This configuration is called **NODE**. Multiple nodes are **queue** making list.
